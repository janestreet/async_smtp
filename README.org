~async_smtp~ is a library that implements SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol), with
functionality for acting as a client or server. In combination with the ~email_message~
library, it is used as the core of Jane Street's internal MTA (Message Transfer Agent, aka
"email server") ~mailcore~.

The library provides a namespace overlay and is intended to be used by starting your
program with.

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
open Async_smtp
#+END_SRC

Users wishing to act as SMTP clients (i.e. to send an email) should look at the
~Simplemail~ module. E.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
  Simplemail.send
    ~to_:[Email_address.of_string_exn "example@example.com"]
    ~subject:"Example message"
    (Simplemail.Content.text "This is an example message.")
#+END_SRC

~async_smtp~ supports more advanced features including TLS and various modes of
SMTP authentication. See the ~sample~ directory for some examples.
